Hi! My name is Rob and I am a Regents Scholar at the University of California, San Diego studying Computer Science. I am on track to graduate in just shy of three years by March 2023 and plan to enter the industry as a Software Engineer post-graduation!

Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at [Werfen](https://www.werfen.com/na/en) in San Diego, California working on the software design of an upcoming whole blood hemostasis testing medical device. Beyond this role, I am interested in gaining more experience in full-stack app development and systems level programming. In particular, I am seeking a mobile, full-stack, or embedded Software Engineer role, ideally involving computer operating systems, networks, and/or security to some capacity!
