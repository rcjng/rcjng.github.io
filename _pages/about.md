Hi! My name is Rob and I am a Regents Scholar at the University of California San Diego studying Computer Science. I am on track to graduate in just shy of three years by March 2023 and plan to enter the industry as a Fullstack Software Engineer shortly after in April!

Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at [Werfen](https://www.werfen.com/na/en) in San Diego, California working on the software design of an upcoming whole blood hemostasis testing medical device.
