      year: 2022
      description: 
      - Developed an Android social networking app in Java that recommends close proximity students to each other based on specific course criteria (number of shared courses, recency of shared courses, etc.)
      - Implemented and iteratively tested multiple features including Bluetooth message sending and receiving via Google Nearby Messages API, data storage and persistence via Room API, sorting/filtering/matching algorithms, and UI view handling via design patterns and object-oriented programming.
      - Merged 70+ commits and made 25,000+ code contributions.
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/rcjng/dynamic-display-settings-switcher">Dynamic Display Settings Switcher (DDSS)</a>
      year: 2022
      description: 
      - Created a system tray application in Python for Windows laptops that automatically switches display settings (screen resolution, refresh rate, and brightness) when connecting or disconnecting from power.
      - Implemented an easy 1-click manual resolution and refresh rate switch feature and a configuration file for storing and changing custom user-defined display setting profiles.
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/rcjng/tracktivity-discord-bot">Tracktivity Discord Bot</a>
      year: 2022
      description:
      - Developed a Discord bot in Go from scratch with 900+ lines of code that continually tracks user and server activity and reports a specific user’s info, activity, and status (Tracktivity profile) upon another user’s request through commands.
      - Implemented 2 command handlers and 12+ Discord event handlers using DiscordGo to handle, generate, and send Tracktivity profile reports via Discord messages and update internal data structure and object data respectively.
    - title: <a href="https://github.com/rcjng/JARchitecture">JARchitecture</a>
      year: 2022
      description: 
      - Developed an accumulator and load-store hybrid computer architecture in SystemVerilog with a Python assembler and a MIPS-esque ISA in just shy of 10,000 code contributions.
      - Implemented 3 programs/algorithms in JARchitecture instructions then verified program correctness using Java to demonstrate architecture usage and functionality.
